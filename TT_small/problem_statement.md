# Supply Chain Resilience Optimization for Global Manufacturing Company

## Business Context

Tekron Industries is a global manufacturer of industrial automation equipment with production facilities in North America, Europe, and Asia. Following recent supply chain disruptions caused by geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, and transportation bottlenecks, the company's COO, Elena Martinez, wants to improve supply chain resilience while maintaining cost efficiency. Elena believes that rethinking supplier selection, inventory management, and transportation routes could create a more adaptable supply chain without significantly increasing costs.

## Hypothesis Definition

### Primary Hypothesis
Tekron Industries can achieve an optimal balance between supply chain resilience and cost efficiency through strategic diversification of suppliers, dynamic inventory management, and flexible transportation routing.

### Sub-hypotheses
1. Diversifying suppliers across geographic regions provides better disruption protection than single-sourcing, with manageable cost impact.
2. Dynamic inventory levels based on component criticality and risk factors minimize capital tie-up while ensuring production continuity.
3. Multi-modal transportation options with real-time rerouting capabilities reduce delivery delays during disruptions.
4. Regional production flexibility allows for rapid response to localized supply chain failures.
